      <p><i>Beezy librarius</i></p>
      <p>Tucked away on the second floor of the art building is a quiet, book-filled space where a
        barely audible buzzing can sometimes be heard. With the enormous quantity of artbooks stored
        away in this room, there are plenty of places for this busy body bee to hide! It takes a
        fascination in organizing and archiving the robust collection. </p>

        <summary>Need a hint?</summary>
        <p>Some say that catching a glimpse of this adorable little librarian helps you in your studies!
          Keep a look out for any glittering as it’s easiest to spot this critter by its holographic wings.
          “Bee” careful not to bring any liquids or dangers to the library room or face the wrath of this hard worker.</p>

      <h2> The Modest Moth </h2>

      <p><i>Mothim timodum</i></p>
      <p>Unlike common moths, this species sports a plethora of vibrant patterning on its body. Even with
        its unusual beauty, this moth tends to shy away from attention and secludes itself. It is an enormous
        labor to spot this critter during the day. However, if you ever manage to spot the cerulean rarity,
        be sure to not use flashy cameras or sudden movements in your observation. </p>
      <details>
        <summary>Need a hint?</summary>
        <p>It may be easiest to get a look at this flying beauty in the dim twilights or in quiet, sight-seeing
          areas of the building. It tends to be just as elusive as any art student who is coming up on assignment deadlines.</p>

      <p><i>Wurm bizonis</i></p>
      <p>Have you ever wondered who keeps the pins on the poster boards stocked or invests in the art department?
        This jovial fellow sure knows! A hard worker and knowledgeable worm, this entrepreneur helps the department
        administration in any minutia both figuratively and literally. This worm may also be responsible for the
        timely upkeep of the building’s security and door locks.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Need a hint?</summary>
        <p>Look out for any comfortable windowsill seating areas. Every shrewd business person needs a peaceful break
          in their busy schedule to relax with a cup of tea by a pleasant window outlook.</p>
